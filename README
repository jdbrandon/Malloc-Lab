 Malloc Lab 15213 / 15513 / 18213 Carnegie Mellon University

This repository is where I did my versioning and source control
for my malloc lab when I took 15213 in the summer of 2014

Do not copy the contents of this repository to submit for any
class, that would be cheating. 

By doing this assignment I learned a great deal about dynamic 
memory allocation.

This may or may not be the version I submitted for grading.
